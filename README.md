# Guess The Build Cheat
You can use this tool from http://detectiveandrew.github.io/guessit/. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to get pretty good at Guess The Build.

# Newly added features

- Clear input button
- Complete rewrite of the tool including new UI
- Ability to search for more than one word

# Contribute
You can contribute to this project mostly by adding words to the _wordlist-xxxx.txt_ files if you notice any are missing. Don't forget to separate each with a comma except after the last word. No need to add them in alphabetical order.

Also, if you could share this with your friends and with other players, I would be really glad! This way it will spread faster, more words will be discovered, making it more reliable.

You can use any of this code for any purpose, including selling it. Good luck with the last point though. And I would like you to give me credit.
